Abstract: A collaboration between the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Research, Demonstration, and Innovation and New York City Transit (NYCT) is currently underway to study the wheel-rail interaction on NYCT's Flushing Line. This project assesses the performance of vehicles and tracks on the Flushing Line, which serves as a representative sample of the NYCT system and other rail transit systems. It has the objective of demonstrating how the use of existing technologies could generate the kind of data-driven information and analytics that could improve wheel and track condition-based maintenance. 
The Instrumented Wheelset (IWS) is a wheelset developed by the NRC that has been equipped with strain gauges providing measurements of the forces at the wheel/rail contact. In this presentation, we show how the we developed a methodology that takes recorded IWS data as an input, integrated the data through time warping techniques, and identified anomalies and trends in the data via dimensionality reduction, clustering, and spectral analysis techniques.
