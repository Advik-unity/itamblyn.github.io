Title: Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Non-Compliance on Wood-Packaging Material
Brian Kowaluk, Jae-Jin Ryu, Joanna Grenon (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)
Every year, hundreds of billions of packaged merchandises are imported to Canada. Among these, certain types of packaging material could pose significant risks to Canadaâ€™s environmental health, as they could act as a pathway for foreign plant pets, diseases or invasive species. In order to mitigate these risks, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has developed regulations and the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) conducts related oversight activities to verify compliance of packaging materials imported into the country. In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing oversight activities, we have developed a proof of concept for a decision support tool based on machine learning algorithms. More specifically, we built predictive models on the data set of imported packages using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm with data balancing techniques. Based on the model with best performance with a low false-positive rate, an app has been developed.
