Title: Deep learning for automatic topographic feature extraction
Presenter: Mathieu Turgeon-Pelchat
NRCan’s Centre of Expertise in Geomatics supports R&D of new technologies and methods used in
geomatics and remote sensing. Among ongoing projects is the use of deep learning to create an
infrastructure to automatically extract topographic features from imagery. This helps us create base maps
rapidly and accurately. The creation of new geospatial products extracted from high-resolution sources
also gives us the opportunity for complex analyses such as flood simulations and solar potential mapping,
which ultimately allows for precise geo-located decision-making. The system we have developed uses AI,
specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks for the detection and classification of
topographic features such as buildings, roads, forests and waterbodies. The intent of this presentation is
to describe our deep-learning based application and discuss the potential uses and limitations of such
system.
